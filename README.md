# willow.camp v2

[willow.camp](https://willow.camp) is a minimalist blogging platform. I wrote the first version of willow.camp in Rails with all the tools that framework comes with. 

willow.camp v2 is a re-write of the same platform using Gleam , Wisp, and packages from the Gleam ecosystem. 

## The Name

willow.camp is named after a playful and curious dog, Willow. Willow's full name is Will-o-the-Wisp. So of course, when I saw the Wisp framework, I knew the repo for this project had to be named `will-o-the-wisp`.
